# Wall Obstacles & Fruit Physics - Update

## ✅ **Wall Obstacles Added:**

### 🧱 **Pipe-Style Walls**
- **Green pipe-like walls** with gaps that spawn every 4 seconds
- **180px gap size** - large enough for birds to pass through safely
- **60px wall width** with 3D visual effects and pipe caps
- **Golden glow** highlighting the gaps for better visibility
- **Synchronized across all players** - everyone sees the same walls

### 🎯 **Wall Collision System**
- Birds **die instantly** if they hit the wall (top or bottom parts)
- **Precise collision detection** between bird rectangles and wall areas
- **Real-time death sync** - all players see deaths immediately
- **Gray death effects** with explosion particles

## ✅ **Fruit Physics Upgraded:**

### 🏀 **Realistic Bouncing**
- Fruits now **bounce off walls** instead of passing through
- **Gravity applied** to fruits (0.2 acceleration downward)
- **Energy loss** on bounces (20% velocity reduction)
- **Horizontal & Vertical bouncing** based on collision angle
- **Screen boundary bouncing** (top/bottom of game area)

### ✨ **Visual Effects**
- **Bounce particles** when fruits hit walls
- **Blue particles** for horizontal bounces
- **Gold particles** for vertical bounces
- **Realistic physics** with position reset to prevent clipping

## 🎮 **New Gameplay Dynamics:**

### **Strategic Elements:**
1. **Navigation Challenge**: Players must time jumps to pass through wall gaps
2. **Fruit Collection Risk**: Fruits bounce around walls, creating dynamic targets
3. **Collision Avoidance**: Both walls AND fruits can kill players
4. **Team Coordination**: All players navigate the same synchronized obstacles

### **Physics Realism:**
- Fruits now behave like **bouncing balls** with gravity
- **Realistic collision responses** with energy conservation
- **Dynamic fruit movements** make slicing more challenging
- **Wall interactions** create unpredictable fruit trajectories

## 🚀 **Test the New Features:**

```bash
npm start  # Start the server
ngrok http 3001  # Share with friends
```

Now the game has:
- ✅ **Flappy Bird-style wall obstacles** with gaps
- ✅ **Fruit bouncing physics** off walls and boundaries  
- ✅ **Real-time collision detection** for both walls and fruits
- ✅ **Synchronized multiplayer** obstacles and physics
- ✅ **Visual feedback** for all collisions and bounces

The gameplay is now much more dynamic and challenging! 🎯🎮
